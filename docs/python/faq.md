## How to setup Mac M1?

Since the M1 Macs have a different architecture than the previous releases, there might be some incompatibility issues with some apps/software/libraries. To avoid that experience you're advised to activate Rosetta [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861). 

- Install all OS updates, via System Preferences
- To activate Rossetta open Finder
    1. if using [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) go to Applications
    2. if using default Terminal go to Applications/Utilities
- Right-click the terminal app of your choice and select the `Get Info` option
- Then just click on the Checkbox that says `Open using Rosetta`
- Restart the terminal 
- Now your terminal can run as it would on an Apple with an Intel processor
- Install HomeBrew [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/) from that terminal
