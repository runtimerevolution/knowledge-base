## Day 8 - Project

This project consists on the development of a Rest api to manage/views: Authors, Books and Categories.

### Requirements

- User needs to be able to manage Authors, Books, and Categories in the app.
- Each Author can have many Books that he/her has written and each book can be included in multiple categories.
- The User should be able to view lists of Authors and Books.
- The Books should be able to be filtered by Author and by Category.

> Optional: The App should also include a page to view some basic statistics, like the number of Books per Author, or the number of Books per Category.

Optional: To complicate the models. A book can have many instances and users can request an instance to take home with a
requested date.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Design the model entity relation for this project:
    - use [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html), this is supported out of the box by Github's Markdown
- Design the API endpoints, including:
    - path
    - request
    - response

Once the design/planning part has been taken care of and agreed upon, please create tickets/issues for each of the tasks. Having those created, their commits should respect the nomenclature used in the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

- if it's a task: `task/<number_of_the_ticket>/small-description`;
- if it's a bug: `bugfix/<number_of_the_ticket>/small-description`;
- if it's a release: `chore/<number_of_the_ticket>/small-description`.

> Read the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) documentation to check more examples and details of each commit type (i.e body, footer, etc).
