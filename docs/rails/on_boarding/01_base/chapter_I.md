# Chapter I - Introduction to Ruby
`(avr. time for this chapter: 1 day)`

Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms. Designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity, Ruby treats everything as an object, including primitive data types. It was developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.

Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection and just-in-time compilation. It supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming paradigms.

In this chapter, the objective is to explore the fundamentals of Ruby, which will serve as the foundation for the next chapters where you will delve into Rails, one of the most popular frameworks built with Ruby.
