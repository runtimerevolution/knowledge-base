# Chapter II - Introduction to Ruby on Rails
`(avr. time for this chapter: 2 days)`

Ruby on Rails (commonly referred to as Rails) is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, providing default structures for databases, web services, and web pages.

In this chapter, the objective is to understand how Rails works. This is primarily a learning phase—you do not need to write extensive code, only what helps reinforce your understanding. Focus on comprehension rather than implementation.

The recommended course has several chapters, but for this onboarding, we focus on the essentials that will prepare you for the practical exercises ahead.
