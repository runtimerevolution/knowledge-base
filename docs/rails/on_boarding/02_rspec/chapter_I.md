# Chapter I
`(avr. time for this chapter: TBD)`

Tests are a important aspect of any project, serving as a vital checkpoint to ensure that everything functions as intended while preventing any unforeseen issues that may arise when introducing new features.

As such, the quality of a project is heavily influenced by the quality of its tests.

In this chapter, you will acquire a comprehensive understanding of RSpec, a testing tool designed specifically for Ruby and rooted in the principles of Behavior Driven Development (BDD). RSpec equips you with a rich array of features that facilitate a flexible and easily comprehensible syntax for your tests.

You will also learn about some useful gems that enhance RSpec's capabilities in specific situations, such as FactoryBot, VCR, Timecop and others.

>Before starting, ensure that you have completed the RSpec course [Testing Ruby with RSpec: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/testing-ruby-with-rspec/) as well as the `01_base` section.

>If you have any questions or require access credentials, do not hesitate to reach out to your mentor.

## Factories

[FactoryBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot) proves to be an useful gem, enabling you to define prototypes for models that can be seamlessly integrated into your specs.

This is very helpful for enhancing the organization of your specs, as it consolidates the creation process for any object related to a particular model.

For more comprehensive insights into FactoryBot and its practical implementation, consult their documentation available in their [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/wiki).

As a practical step, create factories for `Book`, `Order`, and `User` models.

## Models

Model tests are very important because they will ensure your models keep respecting all the rules you have defined for them.

These tests should be comprehensive, addressing any and all restrictive behaviors associated with the model's attributes.

Create the necessary specs to validate the behavior of all your models.

## Requests

Every route that the server accepts should be tested for both the error and success conditions and their results.

This includes testing several aspects of the server's routes, including but not limited to authentication, parameter validation, and operational success constraints.

Create the necessary specs to validate all routes of your project server open for communication.

## Routing

A good practice for testing a project is to verify its capability to correctly route each declared route to the corresponding controller methods.

Create the necessary specs to validate your project routing to their corresponding controllers.

## Aggregating failures

When incorporating multiple expectations within a single spec, there is an option to aggregate failures, meaning that all expectations are executed, providing a comprehensive view of all potential issues rather than halting at the first failure.

This aggregation of failures offers the advantage of more informative error messages, which can be particularly helpful during troubleshooting. However it comes at a high cost of performance.

> Considering the small size of this project, it is in our best interest to aggregate all failures. This approach simplifies the process of identifying problems and their respective solutions at the start of the project, ensuring a smoother testing and debugging experience.

## Coumpound expectations

There are often situations where you'll find the need to set expectations multiple times for the same object.

In such cases, it's considered a best practice to employ compound expectations. This not only helps in reducing the size of your specs but also enhances their readability.

With this in mind use coumpound expectations for any specs you seem fit.
