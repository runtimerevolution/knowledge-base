# Chapter III

## React for beginners

React is a popular open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. Here are some key features and concepts of React:

* __Component-Based Architecture__: React applications are built using components, which are reusable and independent pieces of the UI. Each component manages its own state and can be composed to build complex UIs.
* __Virtual DOM__: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering. When the state of an object changes, React updates the virtual DOM first, then compares it with the real DOM and updates only the parts that have changed. This makes updates faster and more efficient.
* __JSX Syntax__: React uses JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. This makes it easier to create and visualize the structure of the UI components.
* __Unidirectional Data Flow__: React enforces a one-way data flow, meaning data flows from parent components to child components. This makes it easier to understand and debug the application state.
* __Hooks__: React provides hooks, such as `useState` and `useEffect`, which allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components.
* __Ecosystem and Community__: React has a large ecosystem of libraries and tools, as well as a strong community, which provides a wealth of resources, tutorials, and third-party components.

React is widely used in the industry and is known for its performance, scalability, and simplicity.

## Getting started

There is no better way to get started in React than reading their [official documentation](https://react.dev/learn){ target=_blank }.

## Improving your knowledge

Once you're done with the official documentation, and if you want to expand your knowledge, then follow the [Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react). It is a 28-part course with videos and lessons that will help you learn things like:

* What is JSX and how to use it effectively with React
* Create simple and reusable React components
* Style React components with className and inline Styles
* What are hooks and how to create your own
* Make and manage basic forms
* Make HTTP requests
* Install and use React DevTools for debugging
* Build and deploy a React Application with Codesandbox, GitHub, and Netlify

## Extras

Your journey through React does not have to end here though! Keep reading the following sections to know more about specific frameworks, packages, tools, etc.

* [Redux](../../02_Advanced_Tools/redux)
* [React-Router](../../02_Advanced_Tools/react-router)
