# Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs){ target=_blank } is a popular open-source React framework developed by Vercel that enables developers to build server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated web applications. It provides a range of features and optimizations out of the box, making it easier to build performant and scalable applications. Key features of Next.js include:

* __Server-Side Rendering (SSR)__: Next.js allows pages to be rendered on the server, improving performance and SEO.
* __Static Site Generation (SSG)__: Next.js can generate static HTML at build time, which can be served directly by a CDN.
* __API Routes__: Next.js provides a way to create API endpoints within the same application, simplifying the development of full-stack applications.
* __File-Based Routing__: Next.js uses a file-based routing system where the file structure in the pages directory maps directly to the routes of the application.
* __Automatic Code Splitting__: Next.js automatically splits the code for each page, ensuring that only the necessary code is loaded for each page.
* __Built-in CSS and Sass Support__: Next.js supports importing CSS and Sass files directly in JavaScript files.
* __Image Optimization__: Next.js includes an image component that optimizes images for faster loading and better performance.
* __TypeScript Support__: Next.js has built-in TypeScript support, making it easy to use TypeScript in your projects.

Next.js is widely used for building modern web applications due to its flexibility, performance optimizations, and ease of use.
