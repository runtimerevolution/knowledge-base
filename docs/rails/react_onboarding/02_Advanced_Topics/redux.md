Redux is a global state management library. It has an official integration with React, called [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/){ target=_blank }.

## Getting started

You can learn more about Redux and how to use it in your web application by watching this [free course and tutorial](https://egghead.io/courses/fundamentals-of-redux-course-from-dan-abramov-bd5cc867){ target=_blank }, made by Dan Abramov himself, the creator of React-Redux.

Ideally, with this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Learn how to add proper state management to your React app
* Dive through reducers and how to manipulate state changes
* Learn to propagate the changes to the components
* Build a "to-do" list app using Redux
